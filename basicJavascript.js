/*Comment Your JavaScript Code
Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore.
Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other people who
will later need to figure out what that code does.
There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript:

Using // will tell JavaScript to ignore the remainder of the text on the current line. 
This is an in-line comment:

// This is an in-line comment.
You can make a multi-line comment beginning with /* and ending with */

/* This is a
multi-line comment */

//create the variable with My Name
var myName
//asig the value 7 to the variable a
var a;
a=7;
var b;
b=7;
b=a;
//asign a value at the first
var c = 9
//create a string values and asign a value
var myFirstName = "Maria";
var myLastName = "Rios Navarro";

var d = 5;
var e = 10;
var f ="I am a";

d= d + 1;
e = e + 5;
f = f + " String!";

//use camelCase-Variable declarations
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

// Variable assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;

//introducing the difference between var and let. (let can not be more times declared, you can not overridden: important ES6)
let catName = "Oliver";
let catSound = "Meow!";

//introduce the difference between let and const. With Const you can not reassigning the value. The console will display an error due to reassigning the value, const is READ-ONLY and can not change
// It is common for developers to use uppercase variable identifiers for immutable values and lowercase or camelCase for mutable values (objects and arrays).
const FCC = "freeCodeCamp"; 
let fact = "is cool!"; 
fact = "is awesome!";
console.log(FCC, fact); 

// Add Two Numbers with JavaScript
const sum = 10 + 10;

//Subtract One Number from Another with JavaScript
const difference = 45 - 33;

//Multiply Two Numbers with JavaScript
const product = 8 * 10;

//Divide One Number by Another with JavaScript
const quotient = 66 / 33;

//Increment a Number with JavaScript
let myVarA = 87;
myVarA++;

//Decrement a Number with JavaScript
let myVarB = 11;
myVarB--;

//Create Decimal Numbers with JavaScript (float numbers)
const ourDecimal = 5.7;
const myDecimal= 5.7;

//Multiply Two Decimals with JavaScript
const productDecimal = 2.0 * 2.5;

//Divide One Decimal by Another with JavaScript
const quotientDecimal = 4.4 / 2.0;

//Finding a Remainder in JavaScript % (Note: The remainder operator is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the modulus operator. It is very similar to modulus, but does not work properly with negative numbers.)
const remainder = 11%3

//Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition: += Operator
let g = 3;
let h = 17;
let j = 12;

//Use += operator
g += 12;
h += 9;
j += 7;

//Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction: -= Operator
g -= 6;
h -= 15;
j -= 1;

//Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication: *= Operator
g *= 5;
h *= 3;
j *= 10;

//Compound Assignment With Augmented Division: /=Operator
g /= 12;
h /= 4;
j /= 11;

// Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings: with \ beforr " or '. In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash (\) in front of the quote.
const myStrB = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\".";

// Quoting Strings with Single Quotes. String values in JavaScript may be written with single or double quotes, as long as you start and end with the same type of quote
// Sometimes we have an ' in the middle of the sentence and if we do not mark it before with \ it will give us an error

const myStrC = '<a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">Link</a>';

// Escape Sequences in Strings
// Assign the following three lines of text into the single variable myStr using escape sequences.

/* FirstLine
    \SecondLine
ThirdLine

You will need to use escape sequences to insert special characters correctly. You will also need to follow the spacing as it looks above, with no spaces between escape sequences or words.*/

const myStrD = "FirstLine\n\t\\SecondLine\nThirdLine"

//Explanation:
/* Escape sequences allow you to use characters you may not otherwise be able to use in a string.

Code	Output
\'	single quote
\"	double quote
\\	backslash
\n	newline
\t	tab
\r	carriage return
\b	backspace
\f	form feed
Note that the backslash itself must be escaped in order to display as a backslash.

In our example we need:
After -FirstLine- we need
a new line with: \n
a Tab with: \t
a \ with \\
than is -SecondLine-
after that we need a new line with : \n
and -ThirdLine_

// Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator. Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

const myStrE = "This is the start. " + "This is the end."

// Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator. Note: Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself

let myStrE;
myStrE = "This is the first sentence. ";
myStrE += "This is the second sentence.";
