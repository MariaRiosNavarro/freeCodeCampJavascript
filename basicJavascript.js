/*Comment Your JavaScript Code
Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore.
Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other people who
will later need to figure out what that code does.
There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript:

Using // will tell JavaScript to ignore the remainder of the text on the current line. 
This is an in-line comment:

// This is an in-line comment.
You can make a multi-line comment beginning with /* and ending with */

/* This is a
multi-line comment */

//create the variable with My Name
var myName
//asig the value 7 to the variable a
var a;
a=7;
var b;
b=7;
b=a;
//asign a value at the first
var c = 9
//create a string values and asign a value
var myFirstName = "Maria";
var myLastName = "Rios Navarro";

// Only change code below this line
var d = 5;
var e = 10;
var f ="I am a";
// Only change code above this line

d= d + 1;
e = e + 5;
f = f + " String!";

//use camelCase

// Variable declarations
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

// Variable assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;
